0. Intro

Colormyday is a visual time tracker based on a horizontal calendar
(ie horizontal hours and vertical days). It has a main, graphical 
"curses mode", but it can also be used via script.

It records time within the framework of events and categories of
events. An event consists in a named behavior which can be begun and 
ended at arbitrary times, one at a time (eg "Breakfast"). Events can
be groups into categories, which can be assigned names and colors. in
curses mode, events are drawn out in color, hence "colormyday".

1. Local files

All data and configuration are read out of a directory (here called 
$D) which defaults to ~/.colormyday but can be set with a 
command-line option.

It's expected to look like this:

- $D/
|- data/
 |- 1615928460-1615935000
 |- ...
|- groups
|- config

If this structure does not exist at $D, it will be created.

1.1. Event data

Colormyday reads event data out of a directory $D/data.

Event data consists in event files. An event file corresponds to a 
single event and is named $START-$END (ex. 1615928460-1615935000). It
contains a single line of xml in this form:

<event><title>Lunch</title><note>-1</note></event>

1.2. Group data

Colormyday reads groups, their colors, and corresponding events out 
of a file $D/groups. It contains xml in the form:

<groups>
  <group>
    <title>Sleep</title>
    <color>170024</color>
    <members>
      <event>Sleep</event>
      ...
    </members>
  </group>
  ...
</groups>
